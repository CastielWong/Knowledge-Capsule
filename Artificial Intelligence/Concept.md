AI is a broad field that encompasses the development of intelligent systems capable
of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as perception,
reasoning, learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.

AI serves as an umbrella term for various techniques and approaches, including Machine
Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI.


AI project Lifecycle:
- AI framework:
  Identify user case
  -> Experiment and select
  -> Adapt, align, and augment
  -> Evaluate
  -> Deploy and integrate
  -> Monitor
- AI cycle:
  Design -> Develop -> Deploy -> Maintain
- Gen AI Lifecycle:
  Data selection -> Model selection -> Pre-training
  -> Fine-tuning -> Evaluation -> Deployment
  -> Guardrails -> Monitoring -> Feedback

Types of AI technologies:
- Image Generation
- Text Generation
- Speech Generation and Recognition
- Multimodal AI

How AI is used today:
- Content Recommendation
- Personalized Shopping Experiences
- Healthcare
- Forecasting
- Traffic Management


## Scope
From largest to smallest:
- AI: Any technique that allows computers to mimic human intelligence using logic,
if-then statements, and machine leaning
- ML: A subset of AI that uses machines to search for patterns in data to build logic models automatically
- DL: A subset of ML composed of deeply multi-layered neural networks that perform
tasks like speech and image recognition, which uses the concept of neurons and synapses
similar to how our brain is wired
- Generative AI: Powered by large models that are pre-trained on vast corpora of data
and commonly referred to as Foundation Models (FM)
