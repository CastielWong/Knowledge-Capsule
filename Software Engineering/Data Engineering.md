The __Data Steward__ completes daily tasks for projects, while the __Data Owner__
owns policies about the data that guides the work of the data steward.

Best practices of Data Engineering to implement privacy-enhancing technologies:
- implement data masking, data obfuscation, or differential privacy mechanisms to
reduce the risk of data breach
- use encryption, tokenization, or secure multi-party computation to protect data
during processing and storage


### Governance
Discovery and Understanding:
- Data Profiling: systematically examine data to determine whether anything is
wrong with it and to understand data characteristics
- Data Catalog: make data available to those who need access to it
- Data Lineage: document where data originated and where it was moved,
transformed and stored

Curation:
- Data Quality Management: addressing data quality issues discovered in data profiling
- Data Integration: collecting and merging data from a variety of sources
- Data Management: reconciling data stored in different systems

Protection:
- Data Security: define who can have access to data and when they should have
access to data
- Data Compliance: understand applicable compliance standards and government
regulations and assure compliance
- Data Lifecycle Management: determine how long data needs to be kept and
where to store the data for appropriate access
