## Inspection Paradox
A statistical illusion that the actual number is different from the observation/inspection.

> In general, if the actual average is x, it will be overrepresented in the sample by a factor of x.

Take the class size in a colleague for example,
When asking how big the classes are:
- the average of students responses could be 90
- while the actual average size is 35

Assuming there are 4 classes and the sizes are: [10, 10, 10, 110], then:
- ask students (10 + 10 + 10 + 110 = 140):
  - all responses: (10 * 10) * 3 + 110 * 110 = (100 * 3 + 12,100)
  - the average: 12,400 / 140 = 88.57
- ask college, the average: (10 + 10 + 10 + 110) / 4 = 35

## Simpson's Paradox

|        | Solution A       | Solution B       |
|--------|------------------|------------------|
| Case A | 90% = 90 / 100   | 80% = 640 / 800  |
| Case B | 30% = 300 / 900  | 25% = 50 / 200   |
| Total  | 39% = 390 / 1000 | 69% = 690 / 1000 |

Though solution A outperform solution B in both cases, the accuracy of solution A underperforms when combining both cases number.

The reason why this paradox occurs is because:
- The amount of both cases are not equally distributed
- The final accuracy is inclined to the case which gets more amount
- The final accuracy weights more on the predominant case

### Quintessence
The drug effect on different genders experiment:
|            | Male            | Female        | Weighted Average | Arithmetic Mean           |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|---------------------------|
| Experiment | 40.0% =  8 / 20 | 7.5% = 3 / 40 | 18.3% = 11 / 60  | 23.75% = (40.0 + 7.5) / 2 |
| Control    | 30.0% = 12 / 40 | 5.0% = 1 / 20 | 21.7% = 13 / 60  | 17.50% = (30.0 + 5.0) / 2 |
| Ensemble   | 33.3% = 20 / 60 | 6.7% = 4 / 60 | 20.0% = 24 / 120 | 20.00% = (33.3 + 6.7) / 2 |

We could tell the drug is taking effects from __Weighted Average__ as the morbidity decreased to 18.3% from 21.7.

However, when we let the gender group consistently equal and check __Arithmetic Mean__, the morbidity was actually increased, from 17.50% to 23.75%.

The paradox here happens at the gender difference, for which such drug has different effects between genders. It harms male more than female. In that case, so long as there is more male than female in control group, it's likely the __Weighted Average__ would look better.

## Anscombe's Quartet
Anscombe's Quartet comprises 4 datasets that have nearly identical simple
descriptive statistics, yet have very different distributions and appear very
different when graphed.
Each dataset consists of eleven (x, y) points.
They were constructed in 1973 by the statistician Francis Anscombe to demonstrate
both the importance of graphing data when analyzing it, and the effect of outliers
and other influential observations on statistical properties.
He described the article as being intended to counter the impression among
statisticians that "numerical calculations are exact, but graphs are rough"

### Dataset
| Dataset I | Dataset II | Dataset III | Dataset IV |

| x | y | x | y | x | y | x | y |

| 8.0 | 6.95 | 8.0 | 8.14 | 8.0 | 6.77 | 8.0 | 5.76 |
| 13.0 | 7.58 | 13.0 | 8.74 | 13.0 | 12.74 | 8.0 | 7.71 |
| 9.0 | 8.81 | 9.0 | 8.77 | 9.0 | 7.11 | 8.0 | 8.84 |
| 11.0 | 8.33 | 11.0 | 9.26 | 11.0 | 7.81 | 8.0 | 8.47 |
| 14.0 | 9.96 | 14.0 | 8.10 | 14.0 | 8.84 | 8.0 | 7.04 |

| 7.0 | 4.82 | 7.0 | 7.26 | 7.0 | 6.42 | 8.0 | 7.91 |
| 5.0 | 5.68 | 5.0 | 4.74 | 5.0 | 5.73 | 8.0 | 6.89 |

### Statistics
| Property | Value | Accuracy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mean of x | 9 | exact |
| Sample variance of x | 11 | exact |
| Mean of y | 7.50 | to 2 decimal places |
| Sample variance of y | 4.125 | ±0.003 |
| Correlation between x and y | 0.816 | to 3 decimal places |
| Linear regression line | y = 3.00 + 0.500x | to 2 and 3 decimal places, respectively |
| Coefficient of determination of the linear regression | 0.67 | to 2 decimal places |
